Serverless: Deprecation warning: Resolution of lambda version hashes was improved with better algorithm, which will be used in next major release.
            Switch to it now by setting "provider.lambdaHashingVersion" to "20201221".
            While it is highly encouraged to upgrade to new algorithm, you can still use the old approach by setting "provider.lambdaHashingVersion" to "20200924".
